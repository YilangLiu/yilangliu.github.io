The goal of the project is to develop a fundamental technology associate with the design and control of an upper-body exoskeleton that augments human arm strength and endurance during lifting motion. The technology is intended to be used by military soldiers who are required to frequently lift more than 100 pounds objects, such as heavy machinery, tank ammunition, etc.
