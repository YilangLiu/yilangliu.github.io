I am a MS student in Mechanical Engineering Research program at the Carnegie Mellon University. After obtaining my undergraduate degree from both University of Cincinnati and Chongqing University, I joined prof. Amir Barati Farimani research group in Fall 2020. My interests lie in mobile robot control in complex environment using deep reinforcement learning, and robot SLAM in 3D. For more detail about my research, please check my projects and CV. Below are some snapshots of my current reseach projects.
